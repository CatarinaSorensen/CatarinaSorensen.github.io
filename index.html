      <p>In the course Advanced Interaction Design at Lund University one of the assignments were to create a app using one or many of the smartphones features like GPS, accelerometer or gyro. We decided to create an Android application where you can take a picture with the front camera by shaking your phone. Before taking the picture you can change filter by tilting the phone left or right.  </p>

      <p> Arkad is a company fair at Lund University faculty of engeneering with approximatly 120 companys attending each year. Every year a new website and smartphone applications are created by students. I were responsible for the Android application 2013 and developed the application by myself. By fetching data with a Json api and on the smartphone locally store the users preferences I created the application which was publisched in Google Play during 2013 and had about 500 downloads. I also created all graphics used in the app except for the maps and of course the companies icons. </p>
